## Deriving and Plotting Derivatives in R

Here, we can explore how to derive and plot derivatives from their parent functions using ggplot and D()

### Load the packages*
**NOTE: You'll need to use install.packages if R cannot find them.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### Finding slopes

Find the slope of f(x) = x^2 if x = 3. 

```{r}
#we can use the D() function directly without having to store the expression in a variable
my_deriv <- D(exp = expression(x^2), name = "x")
x = 3
eval(my_deriv)

## do the same thing for: P(a) 2(3a+2)^4 05 if a = 1.2
my_deriv <- D(exp = expression(2*(3*a + 2)^4 - 5), name = "a")
a = 1.2
eval(my_deriv)

```
